Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers. By linking blocks of data chronologically and cryptographically, it creates a transparent and tamper-proof system that verifies information through consensus mechanisms without a central authority. Key applications include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, smart contracts, and supply chain management, providing security, trust, and efficiency without traditional intermediaries.
